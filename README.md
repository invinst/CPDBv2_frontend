## Development

### Getting Started

- Install `yarn`
- `yarn start` to run development server.
- visit `localhost:9966` to see live changes.

### Run Unit Tests

- `yarn test` to run tests.
- `yarn cover` will run tests and output coverage statistics to console.

### Run Integration Tests

- `yarn integration-test` to run selenium tests.
- `yarn integration-test -- --spec ./integration-test/<test-name>.js` to run specific test.

### CircleCI 

#### Setup

We're using CircleCI 2.0 which makes use of docker images. For this repo, we're running CircleCI on our
[custom image](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/custom-images/) which is built from `.circleci/docker/Dockerfile` and currently published as `cpdbdev/cpdbv2_frontend`
on Docker Hub.

#### Environment Variables:
- `SKIP_COVERALLS`: set to `true` to skip sending coverage report to Coveralls. Only do this if Coveralls is down.

## Deployment

Deployment should be almost automatic depending on which branch you pushed. 
- `master` branch push will trigger production deploy
- `beta` branch push will trigger beta deploy
- `staging` branch push will trigger staging deploy

If you want to see each step, look at `.circleci/config.yml`.

### Building & pushing the docker image

**Important: Current version of Docker image is 0.1.2. Please update this when you make changes to it.**

```bash
docker login
docker build -t cpdbdev/cpdbv2_frontend:0.1.2 .circleci/docker
docker push cpdbdev/cpdbv2_frontend:0.1.2
```

Remember to bump the version of course.
